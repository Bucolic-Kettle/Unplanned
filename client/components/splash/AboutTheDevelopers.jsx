            <p>
              A traveler at heart, Sepehr walks to Hack Reactor to learn coding with
              a computer, where code is written. He started coding when he decided
              to program and build things, such as applications. He can often be found
              breathing, talking, and standing up -- sometimes sitting as well.

            <h3>Tai Huynh</h3>
            <p>
              One of Tai's special talents is being able to see and visualize the things
              that are in front of him with his eyes, such as the moving cars and buses
              when crossing the street, or the computer screen in front of him when
              he codes. He started coding at the same time when people decided that they
              wanted to get into coding, and from there he utilized his ability to see
              to do great things.

            <h3>Leo Adelstein</h3>
            <p>
              Leo grew up in the United States, the son of a father and a mother, who
              raised him with food, water, and air. His interests in coding began when
              he started becoming interested in coding, where he built mobile apps that
              were made for mobile devices. His interest in people stems from being
              a part of a species that is social by nature.
