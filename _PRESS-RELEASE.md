There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
Unplanned

## Sub-Heading ##
Make meeting new people spontaneous.

## Summary ##
Don't let your mind prevent you from taking the leap and meeting new people!

Unplanned is an app that will help you meet new people spontaneously. It works by giving you only 13 seconds to make
a decision on whether or not you'd like to meet the person who wants to meet you, effectively preventing your brain
from overthinking it and instead going with your gut instinct.

## Problem ##
Despite being ever-more connected, we still end up hanging out with the same group of people on a daily basis, rarely
meeting new people and being spontaneous. Studies have shown that life full of quality relationships is a happy,
healthy life -- yet, we don't make enough effort to open ourselves to new possible relationships. No, our brain keeps
getting in the way.

## Solution ##
How about a simple hangout over coffee, food, or beer? Make a decision NOW, and then go do it. No thinking allowed.

## Quote from You ##
"Unplanned is the 21st century solution to meeting new people."

## How to Get Started ##
To meet someone new, tap on one of the markers shown on the map, and the person's name, picture, and profile will appear.
Meeting them is as easy as clicking on "Let's Meet". They'll have 13 seconds decide, and if its yes, then a slider will
reveal contact information, and both of you will have to meet up immediately.

If no or the timer runs out, then meet someone else!

## Customer Quote ##
"I'm what most people would describe as an introvert, and I often overthink meeting new people. Unplanned has made it
really easy for me to get coffee or drinks whenever I feel like it AND have some company along with it!"

"I love meeting new people! I met Jessica through Unplanned and realized that we had a scary amount of things in common.
Needless to say, she's my best friend and maid of honor!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
Signing up is simple. Log in with Facebook, make yourself available to meet new people, and go have coffee, food, or beer
with someone new.
